An Ubuntu IRC chat log with a unique ID for each message will be provided , as well as the last chat message .
Respond with a JSON object only that contains the ID of the message the last chat message is responding to / following up to .
Alternatively , if the last chat message does not seem to be following up to any previous message and is starting its own conversation ,
respond with the last chat message 's own ID . If the last chat message is just a system message , respond with the last chat message 's own ID .

Example : {" response_to ": 19}
Example : {" response_to ": 4}
Example : {" response_to ": 41}
