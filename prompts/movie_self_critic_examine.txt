Another agent has tried to disentangle
the movie scripts (" conversations ") in a
jumbled script . Your task is to decide
which action to take to make any
necessary fixes .
These are the actions available to you :

`assign_utterance ( utterance_id : int ,
new_cluster_id : int )`
Given an utterance 's ID and a cluster
ID , move the utterance to that cluster .

`create_conversation ( utterance_id : int )`
Create a new conversation populated by
the specified utterance .

`finish ()`
Finish the editing process . Run this
once you are content with the results .

- An utterance belongs to a conversation
when it seems to potentially come from
the same script as other utterances in
that conversation .
- " Conversation " refers to a distinct
movie script . If two utterances are from
the same script , they should be in the
same conversation .

Think step - by - step to determine what the
next action should be . Make your final
decision clear at the end so that the
assigner can follow your instruction .
The final decision should be a single
action rather than multiple .
