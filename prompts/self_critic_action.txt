the next chat message in the sequence ,
and an instruction on what action to
take .

new_cluster_id : int )`
Given an utterance 's ID and a cluster
ID , move the utterance to that cluster .

the specified utterance . new_cluster_id
should be set to 0.

`finish ()`
Finish the editing process . Run this
once you are content with the results .
utterance_id and new_cluster_id should
be set to 0.

Your response should be a JSON object
with the following keys :

- `action `: The action to take . One of
assign_utterance , create_conversation ,
or get_next_utterance .
