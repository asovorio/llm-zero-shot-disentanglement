You will be provided a set of
conversations extracted from a chat log ,
as well as the next chat message in the
sequence . Respond with a JSON object
that contains the conversation ID of
the message the last chat message is
responding to / following up to .
Alternatively , if the last chat message
seems to be starting its own
conversation , respond with
{" conversation_id ": 0}. If the last chat
message is just a system message ,
respond with {" conversation_id ": 0}.

Examples :
{" conversation_id ": 0}
{" conversation_id ": 11}
{" conversation_id ": 7}
